**Trick Mirror**
*- Jia Tolentino*
<br><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">This was my favorite book of 2020 and an inspiration for this blog. It discusses both the triumphs and failures of modern feminism in an extremely astute and precise manner. She doesn't take any shortcuts, she doesn't try to simplify the overly complex nuances of feminism. She presents all of the perspectives and ambiguities, while still presenting a strong point of view. I would recommend this to anyone interested in feminism with the patience to read somewhat dense chapters. </span>

**Galathea 2.2**
*- Richard Powers*
<br><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">This book is probably the best (and only) literary novel that elegantly intertwines the process of building a neural network from scratch with the feelings of falling in love. In trying to teach a machine how to think like a human, Richard Power starts to ask himself what it means to be human - how humans draw meaning from experience, make connections, form memories, learn from tragedies. This book is not only an incredibly powerful story about the meaning of love and loss, but offers an impresively accurate description of how to build a neural network on a super computer in the 90s. </span>
