**Trick Mirror**
*- Jia Tolentino*
<br><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">This was my favorite book of 2020 and an inspiration for this blog. It discusses both the triumphs and failures of modern feminism in an extremely astute and precise manner. She doesn't take any shortcuts, she doesn't try to simplify the overly complex nuances of feminism. She presents all of the perspectives and ambiguities, while still presenting a strong point of view. I would recommend this to anyone interested in feminism with the patience to read somewhat dense chapters. </span>

**Galathea 2.2**
*- Richard Powers*
<br><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">This book is probably the best (and only) literary novel that elegantly intertwines the process of building a neural network from scratch with the feelings of falling in love. In trying to teach a machine how to think like a human, Richard Power starts to ask himself what it means to be human - how humans draw meaning from experience, make connections, form memories, learn from tragedies. This book is not only an incredibly powerful story about the meaning of love and loss, but offers an impresively accurate description of how to build a neural network on a super computer in the 90s. </span>

**Permanent Record**
*- Edward Snowden*
<br><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">I find that many critics of digital surveillance and big data have difficulty precisely articulating why it's dangerous. Edward Snowden's memoir - which not only outlines his many impressive accomplishments until the age of 27 - does so in an incredibly captivating and convincing manner. The main basis of his argument is that although our data is currently not being exploited in any extremely dangerous ways (we might laugh at the irrelevant ads and Pokemon Go ploys), the fact that a permanent record of our data exists is highly concerning, as anything could be done with it in the future. He makes a powerful argument that privacy is a fundamental right that everyone should fight for. One of my favorite quotes is "Ultimately, saying that you don’t care about privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different from saying you don’t care about freedom of speech because you have nothing to say". </span>
